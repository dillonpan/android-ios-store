# android-ios-store
Project using Reader within the CSV package for Python

# Project Details:
Let's pretend we work for a company that specializes in creating profitable Android & iOS apps. Assume that the company business model focuses on free to download & install apps but generates income via in-app purchases. This means that one of our primary focuses is on developing apps which attract as many users as possible. Let's gather data on both the App Store on iOS and the Google Play Store on Android.

Since there are millions of apps within each store, we will be using a small sample size of data for this project. Details are as follows and both data sets have been uploaded as well:
1. 'googleplaystore.csv' containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play
2. ''AppleStore.csv''containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store
Note: All of the code below was run using Jupyter Notebook


# Opening and Exploring the Data:
Import the csv package
```python
import csv
```

# The Google Play data set
First we open the file and assign it to a variable(opened_file). Afterwards, we can use the Reader function within the CSV package to appoint the file as a CSV. Lastly, we assign the CSV as a list of rows and seperate the first row (the column headers) from the rest of the data.
```python
opened_file = open('googleplaystore.csv')
read_file = csv.reader(opened_file)
android = list(read_file)
android_header = android[0]
android = android[1:]
```

# The App Store data set
We do the same as above for the iOS data
```python
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
read_file = csv.reader(opened_file)
ios = list(read_file)
ios_header = ios[0]
ios = ios[1:]
```

# Exploring the data
I've created a function titled "explore_data" that we can use to view specific data whenever we want. This function takes in a dataset and prints out the specific rows per user request. It also prints out the total number of rows and columns in the dataset at the end.

```python
def explore_data(dataset, start, end, rows_and_columns=False):
    dataset_slice = dataset[start:end]    
    for row in dataset_slice:
        print(row)
        print('\n')
        
    if rows_and_columns:
        print('Number of rows:', len(dataset))
        print('Number of columns:', len(dataset[0]))
```
We can test out the "explore_data" function by passing the android data set and printing the first 3 rows. Note: The index for Python lists start at 0 and do not include the final number listed. In this case, we passed 0 & 3 as starting and ending variables. However, the printouts will be for rows 0, 1, & 2. Let's also print the column headers to better view the data:
:
```python
print(android_header)
explore_data(android, 0, 3, True)
```
